        <p>Here are some ancient spell fragments found on papyri dating back to the days of the early pharoahs.</p>
        
        <p class="example"><span class="hiero">nD wi</span> &nbsp; <span class="def">heal me</span></p>
        <p class="example"><span class="hiero">bm m=f</span>  &nbsp; <span class="def">make an explosion there</span></p>
        <p class="example"><span class="hiero">rd ssn jr mAA=i tn</span> &nbsp; <span class="def">grow a flower if I see you</span></p>
        
        <p>Even though you probably haven't discovered all of the hieroglyphics in these spells, you can still use them as examples.</p>
