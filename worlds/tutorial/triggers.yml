              the ancient name of Thoth the All-Knowing! I was Neferkaptah, High Priest of
              Thoth to Ramesses II, Pharaoh of Upper and Lower Egypt. We have much to discuss.</p>
              
              <p>Your curiosity has led you to my old study, which has been untouched for 1,000 years. It may also 
              lead you on another great quest: recovering the Book of Thoth, an ancient tome which teaches the language of the gods. When I was High Priest,
              I once set out to find this legendary book. After I acquired it, Thoth did unspeakable things to me and then cursed me
              to be a ghost forevermore. I am warning you: that book is dangerous.</p>
              
              <p>Don't go looking for the Book of Thoth. The gods will never let any human feel its power.
              Others might tell you it is your destiny to find that book.
              Just remember, wise scribe, only fools believe in destiny.</p>
