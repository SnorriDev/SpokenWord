              the ancient name of Thoth the All-Knowing! I was Neferkaptah, High Priest of
              Thoth to Ramesses II, Pharaoh of Upper and Lower Egypt. I will open the door
              to lead you and your friend out of here, but we have other matters to discuss
              first.</p>
              
              <p>Your curiosity and ingenuity have led you into this ancient vault. Before
              you, no one had dared to touch this urn for almost 1,000 years. These same
              qualities might lead you on another great quest: recovering the Book of Thoth,
              an ancient tome which can teach mortals the secret language of the gods. When I was High Priest,
              I set out to find this legendary book. After I acquired it, Thoth forced me to do many terrible
              things and then destroyed me as a punishment. I am warning you: that book is 
              dangerous. Don't go looking for it, because the gods will never let any human feel its power.</p>
              
              <p>It's a good thing I reached out to you now. I imagine others will ask you
              to find my book for them. They might even tell you that it's your destiny.
              Just remember, wise scribe, only fools believe in destiny.</p>
