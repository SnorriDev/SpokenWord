Water behavior, player sinks and drowning timer kicks in, can jump out same as in air

0. Player finds double jump word on beach

1. NPC says to player "I don't know how I'll get across this river, I forgot my boat at home.  If only I could jump high enough to reach thatplatform up there!"  Player will also have to move debris to jump high enough so this should come after the debris level

2. Player will have to use double jump and underwater mechanics (or lack thereof to complete the level)

3. When player reaches NPC again on island later on, the NPC says, "Right after you left a guy was handing out free teleportation spells!  I fucked up though and now I'm stuck here, I'm sure I'll be fine though!"
3a. Possible Idea, when player gets to this dialouge, they can go back to get a teleportation spell from some dude.

4. Statue is end of level
