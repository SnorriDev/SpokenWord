# Boss Fight World

This boss fight in this world pits the player against Neferkaptah, the ancient priest who originally discovered and is guarding the Book of Thoth. The fight is based loosely on the Ptolemaic-era legend, where the hero Setna enters the tomb to steal the book, but is dissuaded by Neferkaptah's powerful magic. See:

A significant theme in this story is that magic belongs to the gods: it is not right for humans to have access to such raw power.
