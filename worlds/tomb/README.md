# Tomb World

This penultimate level is based loosely on the Ptolemaic-era legend, where the hero Setna enters the tomb to steal the Book of Thoth. See:

We want to use certail details from the story here, such as the serpents guarding the tomb. We also want to use generic Egyptian tomb motifs, such as sarcophagi that open into mummies.

A significant theme in this story is that magic belongs to the gods: it is not right for humans to have access to such raw power.
